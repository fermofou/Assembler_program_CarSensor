# Assembly_program_CarSensor
Here is a code that, saving the first 20 measurements on its memmory, takes an average of its records to determine whether the brake light works or not, and shows it as output. Once it has reached a result, it measures the next 20 records again, simulating the continued operation of the sensors in current vehicles.
